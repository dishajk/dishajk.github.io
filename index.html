    <p>Hi, I am Disha. I studied Physics and Mathematics at the <em>National Institute of Science Education and Research</em>, Bhubaneswar, graduated in June 2019. I plan to pursue a career in research and am therefore applying for PhD positions right now. If you are interested in knowing what I did in the past years, check <a href = "/cv">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Over the years, I have learned that aimlessly browsing the internet is an easy but mostly unproductive way to procrastinate. I have found a few alternatives. When I am not drafting graduate school applications, I make TikZ graphics for my friends. If you want any made, you can mail me. I will also be adding it to my '<a href="https://dishajk.github.io/TikZ-bank/">TikZ-bank</a>' in GitHub. If you enjoy coding, I suggest that you check out <a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler</a>. I have solved a few of the easier problems and have added the solutions to <a href="https://github.com/dishajk/Project-Euler">this repository</a>. In the '<a href= "https://aladamara.wordpress.com/">Blog</a>' here, I plan to write about the places I have travelled to, file recipes of dishes that I cooked and liked, and gab about things happening around me.</p>
