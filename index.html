    <p>Hi, I am Disha. I was a master's student at the National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar until this June. I studied Physics and Mathematics. My master's thesis was on a topic in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collision. I plan to pursue a career in research and am therefore applying for PhD positions right now.</p>
    <p>When I am not drafting applications or aimlessly browsing the internet, I make TikZ graphics for my friends. If you want any made, you can mail me. I will also be adding it to my '<a href="https://github.com/dishajk/TikZ-bank">TikZ-bank</a>' in github. In the '<a href= "/blog">Blog</a>' here, I plan to write about the places I have travelled to, file recipes of dishes that I cooked and liked and gab about things happening around me.</p>
