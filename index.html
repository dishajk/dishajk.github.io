    <p>Hi, I am Disha. I studied Physics and Mathematics from the National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar. I graduated this June. My master's thesis was on a topic in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collision. I plan to pursue a career in research and am therefore applying for PhD positions right now. For those interested in knowing what I did in the last five years, check <a href = "/cv">here</a>.</p>
    <p>When I am not drafting applications or aimlessly browsing the internet, I make TikZ graphics for my friends. If you want any made, you can mail me. I will also be adding it to my '<a href="https://github.com/dishajk/TikZ-bank">TikZ-bank</a>' in GitHub. On the right is an image of my face generated using TikZ. My friend, Rupayan Biswas made it for me, acknowledging my fixation with TikZ. In the '<a href= "/blog">Blog</a>' here, I plan to write about the places I have travelled to, file recipes of dishes that I cooked and liked, and gab about things happening around me.</p>
