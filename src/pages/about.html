	  <h2>about me</h2>
<p>
	I'm currently working at the Centre for Science Communication and Outreach at IMSc Chennai. (If you're at IMSc, feel free to check out what I've been up to by clicking <a href="http://sas64.imsc.res.in/disha">here</a>).
</p>
		<p>
			I completed my master's in Physics with a minor in Mathematics at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) in Bhubaneswar. My master's thesis was on Deuteron Production in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collision.
		</p>
		<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, I taught Physics and Mathematics online to high school and first-year engineering students. This experience got me interested in the pedagogical research on mathematics and science education.
		</p>
		<p>In the past, I had the opportunity to visit the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Mumbai in 2018 and the Inter-University Accelerator Centre (IUAC) in New Delhi in the summer of 2016.
		</p>
		<p>Back in college, I served in various leadership roles such as the student-in-charge of the nature club, OorNa, and the literary club, LitC. I also served as a member of the Disciplinary Action Committee and the Election Commission of NISER Studentsâ€™ Gymkhana. Additionally, I was the Mess Secretary and the President of the Hostel Executive Committee at NISER.
		</p>
		<p>I grew up in Bangalore and attended JNV Bangalore Urban for my schooling. During my school days, I participated in Archery and even competed in the 2008 and 2011 SGFI (School Games Federation of India). I also enjoy quizzing and was a semi-finalist in the 2009 TerraQuiz programme of the National Geographic channel.
		</p>
		<p>I enjoy cooking (and eating, of course!). You can check out my 'food-instagram' account in the footer, along with pictures of my crocheting, knitting, and embroidery projects in my 'main-instagram' account.
		</p>
		<p>By the way, I designed this webpage myself! I've been interested in web design since school and learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript over time. Now, I consider it to be another hobby of mine!
		</p>
		<p>Lastly, I am interested in politics, particularly the issues surrounding caste and gender in India.</p>
