	  <h2>about me</h2>
<p>Currently, I am working in the Centre for Science Communication and Outreach at IMSc Chennai. (If you are at IMSc and want to see what I've been doing check <a href="http://sas64.imsc.res.in/disha">this</a>.)</p>
		<p>I did my master's in Physics with a minor in Mathematics at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) Bhubaneswar. My master's thesis was on Deuteron Production in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collision.</p>
		<p>During the covid-19 pandemic, I taught Physics and Mathematics to high school and first-year engineering students online. Teaching got me interested in the pedagogical research on mathematics and science education.</p>
		<p>I visited the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) Mumbai in 2018 and the Inter-University Accelerator Centre (IUAC) New Delhi in the summer of 2016.
		</p>
		<p>In college, I was the student-in-charge of the nature club, OorNa, and the literary club, LitC. I also served as a member of the Disciplinary Action Committee, that of the Election Commission of NISER Studentsâ€™ Gymkhana, as the Mess Secretary, and then as the President of the Hostel Executive Committee at NISER.
		</p>
		<p>I grew up in Bangalore and did my schooling in JNV Bangalore Urban. I did Archery while I was in school, and competed in the 2008 and 2011 SGFI (School Games Federation of India). I enjoy quizzing. I was the semi-finalist of the 2009 TerraQuiz programme of the National Geographic channel.
		</p>
		<p>I love cooking (and eating of course). The footer has a link to my 'food-instagram'. I crochet, knit, and embroider too. Pictures of some of these works are in my 'main-instagram', the link is in the footer.
		</p>
		<p>This webpage is designed by me. I started with HTML while in school, learned CSS while in college, and javascript following the suggestion of a good friend. Now I say that 'Web design' is another hobby of mine!
		</p>
		<p>I am interested in politics, especially that of caste and gender in India.</p>
